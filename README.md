wijets
======

Widgets for Windows...
Wijets are for styling options. They can be moved, clicked, colored (you get the picture?).
They are standalone meaning that they don't require any wijet engines...etc

Installation

1. Most of the projects are on VB6.0 or VB.NET
2. Prerequisities (if any) would be noted in the README file in that particular project
